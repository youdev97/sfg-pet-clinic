# Spring Framework Guru Pet Clinic

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/youdev97/sfg-pet-clinic.svg?style=svg)](<LINK>)

This repo is a project that I built following one of the most popular course about Spring called [Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/?couponCode=GITHUB_SFGPETCLINIC).

Those points were viewed and implemented

* Spring initializer
* H2 Database
* Thymeleaf
* Dependency Injection, beans, Spring Profile
* Spring MVC, Spring Boot Configuration, Profile
* i18N
* JPA Data Modeling, Entity, Relationships
* Lombok
* Tests Junit, Mock, CI (CircleCI integration)
* CRUD Operations with Spring MVC
* Validation and Constraints with Spring MVC

This repo is an opinionated version of the classic reference application - [Spring Pet Clinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)

```console
cd sfg-pet-clinic/pet-clinic-web
mvn wro4j:run
cd ..
mvn clean install
```
